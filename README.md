# Delhi House Price Prediction

Predicting house prices in Delhi using machine learning models.

## Introduction

This project predicts house prices in Delhi based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms (BHK), and more. The goal is to provide insights into the factors influencing house prices and to create accurate price predictions using machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- House area (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms (BHK)
- Number of bathrooms
- Furnishing
- Locality
- Parking
- Price
- Status
- Transaction
- Type
- per_sqft

## Machine Learning Models

The following machine-learning models were used in this project:

- Linear Regression: A simple yet effective model for predicting continuous values based on linear relationships between features.
- Random Forest Regression: A powerful ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the project notebook)
- Required libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delhi-house-price-prediction.git
